## Equinaut
### About
* A web based [equirectangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection) image viewer for desktop, mobile and VR HMD browsers
* This tool started life as something I made in my spare time for a project I was working on at [Second Life](https://secondlife.com) (my day job) which is why you might see some references to it in the code.
* The most common use case is to open the [site](https://equinaut.surge.sh) in your desktop browser and drag an equirectangular image from a folder or your desktop, onto the page to view it.
* In some cases, you can specify a remote image with the `eqr` URL parameter like [this](https://equinaut.surge.sh/?eqr=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Dortmund-Hafen-Sued-Ruine_Panorama_02.jpg) or [this](https://equinaut.surge.sh/?eqr=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Brompton_Oratory_360x180%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg/1920px-Brompton_Oratory_360x180%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg) but this greatly depends on how the server where the image is hosted is configured. (Images from Wikimedia Commons [page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:360%C2%B0_panoramas_with_equirectangular_projection))
* There are, as you might imagine, approximately a bazillion sites out there with example equirectangular images for you to explore. Some like [this](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/) one or [this](https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=equirectangular) one will let you download an image that you can then drag onto the Equinaut page and view it. You can of course, always try a Google [image search](https://www.google.com/search?q=equirectangular+image+examples) too. Please do make sure you follow the licensing/usage terms on whicever site you are using.
* The source code is available [here](https://github.com/callumprentice/equinaut).
* I publish a minified version of the site online [here](https://equinaut.surge.sh/).
* You can of course clone the repository and publish it yourself subject to the terms of the [license](https://github.com/callumprentice/equinaut/blob/main/LICENSE.txt). Please do let me know if you find it useful.
* I am hoping to expand and improve it as time permits but please do submit an [issue](https://github.com/callumprentice/equinaut/issues) if something appears to be broken or you would like to suggest a new feature.
* You can contact me via my own site [here](https://callum.com).
* Credit and thanks to the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [isMobile](https://github.com/kaimallea/isMobile) authors for making great tools. 

### Supported devices
#### Desktop browsers
* Tested (somewhat) on Chrome 91+ (macOS) and Safari 14+
* After the page loads, you can drag an equirectangular image from your desktop or a folder onto the page and it will be displayed

#### Mobile device browsers
* Tested (somewhat) on the iPhone/iPad with Chrome 91+
* Uses the device orientation to rotate the image

#### VR HMD based browsers
* Tested (somewhat) on the Oculus Quest 2 with the Oculus Browser 91+

### Controls
#### Mouse (works in all modes)
* Hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse to explore the panorama
  * You can change the way the image is dragged using the `add` URL parameter (see reference table below)
* After the panorama loads, it will slowly rotate until you interact with it.
  * You can double click the left mouse button to restart this rotation.
  * You can turn this on or off by default using the `ar` URL parameter (see reference table below)

#### Buttons
<img align="left" width="64" height="64" src="img/full_screen.png"></img>
Switches the display to full screen.<br>Click the button again or follow the instructions given by your browser to exit full screen
<p><br>
<img align="left" width="64" height="64" src="img/settings.png"></img>
Open a settings panel that displays some information about the embedded metadata in the image. I hope to expand on this in the future.
<p><br>
<img align="left" width="64" height="64" src="img/sl.png"></img>
If the panorama was created by Second Life, clicking this will open the Second Life SLURL and let you visit that Second Life location directly.

Rudimentary help. For the moment, opens this page in a new browser window.

### URL parameters
|||
|---|---|
|**Name**|`add`|
|Description|Enable or disable the alternative drag direction. Default is to drag the image in the same direction as the mouse moves. Enabling this option reverses that.|

|Example|`?add=false` or `?add=n` or `?add=0`|
|||
|**Name**|`ar`|
|Description|Enable or disable the auto rotation. If auto rotation is enabled, clicking on the image will stop and double-click will start. If auto rotation is disabled, double-clicking will start.|

### For the future
Here are some of the things I have in mind to work on next:
* Navigation. Next feature I would like to work on is an editor that lets you interactively define 'hot spots' in an equirectangular image that link to other images when clicked.
* Image upload. You can drag an image from your computer onto the page to see it locally but you cannot share it with others. There should be a way to upload an image and share that link with anyone. Technically it's not difficult but paying for disk space on a server somewhere can get expensive quickly so I need a robust plan for that
* Better desktop and mobile browser support. I only use Chrome but there are several other great browsers out there and I should make sure it works on all of them
* Support for other VR HMD devices. I only have an Oculus Quest 2 so I cannot test on anything else. If you have a different device and find any problems, please let me know.

### Alternatives
There are plenty of great alternatives out there - here are some I found but there are many more:
* [Online 360Â° Panorama Viewer VR](https://renderstuff.com/tools/360-panorama-web-viewer/)
* [360-image-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/360-image-viewer)
* [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org/)
* [Marzipano](https://www.marzipano.net/)
* [Google VR](https://developers.google.com/vr/discover/360-degree-media)
